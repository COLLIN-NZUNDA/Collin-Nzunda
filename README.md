<h1>Hi, I'm Collin Nzunda! <br/><a href="https://github.com/CollinNzunda" style="color: #007BFF;">Molecular Biologist</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collinnzunda" style="color: #007BFF;">Bioinformatician</a>, <a href="https://x.com/CollinNzunda" style="color: #007BFF;">Data Scientist</a></h1>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me:</h2>

I am a **Molecular Biologist**, **Bioinformatician**, and **Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in **genomic medicine** and **precision oncology**. Currently based at **Muhimbili University of Health and Applied Sciences**, my work revolves around leveraging **next-generation sequencing** (NGS) technologies, including **Nanopore sequencing**, to explore the genetic basis of **hematological malignancies** such as **Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML)** and **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)**.

I specialize in **bioinformatics**, **data science**, and the development of **bioinformatics pipelines** that combine **R**, **Python**, and **LaTeX** for data analysis, visualization, and scientific communication. My work is focused on providing data-driven insights that improve treatment strategies and patient outcomes in **low-resource settings**.
