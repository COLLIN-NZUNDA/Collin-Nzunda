# TP53 and IGHV Mutations in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) in Tanzania

## Project Overview

This repository contains research materials, data analysis scripts, and documentation for the study of **TP53** and **IGHV** (Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable) gene mutations in **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)** patients in Tanzania.

## 🧬 Research Focus

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries, but its prevalence and genetic characteristics in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Tanzania, remain understudied. This project aims to:

- **Analyze TP53 mutations** in Tanzanian CLL patients
- **Study IGHV gene usage patterns** and mutation status
- **Compare findings** with international CLL cohorts
- **Identify population-specific genetic variants** that may influence treatment response
- **Develop targeted treatment strategies** for resource-limited settings

## 🎯 Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Characterize TP53 mutation frequency** in Tanzanian CLL patients
2. **Determine IGHV mutation status** and gene usage patterns
3. **Correlate genetic findings** with clinical outcomes
4. **Assess prognostic implications** of identified mutations

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Develop cost-effective screening methods** for TP53 and IGHV testing
2. **Create population-specific reference data** for Tanzanian CLL patients
3. **Establish collaborative networks** for ongoing CLL research in East Africa
4. **Train local researchers** in molecular diagnostic techniques

## 🧪 Methodology

### Sample Collection
- **Patient recruitment** from Muhimbili National Hospital and affiliated centers
- **Ethical approval** from institutional review boards
- **Informed consent** from all participants
- **Sample processing** and DNA extraction

### Molecular Analysis
- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)** for comprehensive mutation analysis
- **Sanger sequencing** for validation of key mutations
- **IGHV gene rearrangement analysis** using established protocols
- **Bioinformatics pipeline** for variant calling and annotation

### Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive statistics** for mutation frequencies
- **Survival analysis** for prognostic assessment
- **Comparative analysis** with international datasets
- **Population genetics** analysis for ancestry assessment
